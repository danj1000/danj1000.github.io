A description of my duties as a TA:

  - Substitute-taught lectures for the course
  - Graded assignments
  - Modified and improved upon existing homework assignments
  - Created keys for tests
  - Held office hours for responding to questions, teaching students 1:1, and helping students with homework. This was a difficult course for many undergraduates, and my office hours were very occupied with students seeking to get help.
